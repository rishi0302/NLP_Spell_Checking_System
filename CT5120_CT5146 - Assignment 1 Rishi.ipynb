    "List of implementations that can increase the accuracy of the algorithm or model designed in Task 3 and 4 :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As the train dataset is very small we need larger corpus of words to improve the accuracy of model. Use wordnet from nltk corpus by checking if a word is as valid word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stemming and lemmatization- Check whether the each word's stem is present in unique tokens from train and in wordnet because maybe word's stem or lemma might be present in unique words from train or wordnet words so its a valid word and need not be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stopping digits from being corrected by the algorithm as for them the model will get the word with nearest distance but that will disimprove the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Name Entity Recognition with NLTK - Named entity recognition (NER)is probably the first step towards information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. Now in the given data there are many sentence which have names and entities which are not valid words for algorithm and they are corrected hence reducing the accuracy. This step significantly increases the accuracy of the algorithm . For example 2nd sentence in test dataset \"NIGEL THRUSH page 48\" is corrected to \"WIGGLE THEN page 48\" where \"NIGEL\" and \"THRUSH\" are name entities which need not be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bigram Probabilty - Instead of using unigram probability use bigram probability which slighlty inceases the performance of the algorithm due to joint probability distribution of a sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Pointwise Mutual Information(PMI) (Not implemented) - Use PMI instead of bigram probability as PMI of the given bigram is more then they are more likely to occur together in the wild. Hence, we can leverage this while assigning the conditional probability of a word based on its context (previous word). Likewise, the probability of the sentence can be calculated which is the multiplication of probabilities of each word in a sentence.\\\n",
